<p>I am a person who likes toÂ travel a lot. I also like to listen to good music and have great conversations with new people. I rarely workout as I don't go to any gym or go running. I am a foodie, as I always try to have some new taste on my taste buds, but most of all, I love to play new games, as I have played many games, some of which are BGMI, FIFA, GTA, COC, COD, etc.

</p>

<p>I am an organized, efficient, and hard-working person, and I am willing to discover and accept new ideas that can be put into practice effectively. I am a good listener and learner, able to communicate well with a group and on an individual level. I am able to motivate and direct my talents and skills to meet objectives.</p>

<p>Recently, I am learning web development and want to build my career in React.</p>
